Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure of the web application.

Tailwind CSS: Responsive and modern UI styling.

JavaScript: Logic for score calculation, file processing, and chart rendering.

Chart.js: Generates the pie chart for score breakdown.

pdf.js: Extracts text from uploaded PDF resumes.

mammoth.js: Extracts text from uploaded DOCX resumes.

Implementation Details

Score Calculation:

Keyword Match: Extracts unique keywords (4+ letters, excluding stopwords) from the job description and calculates a score based on matches in the resume, scaled by the user-defined weight (default: 60).

Word Count: Awards full points for 300-900 words, half otherwise, scaled by weight (default: 10).

Contact Info: Checks for email and phone using regex, awarding full points if both are present, scaled by weight (default: 10).

Social Links: Detects URLs for LinkedIn, GitHub, etc., awarding full points if present, scaled by weight (default: 10).

Line Spacing: Awards full points for â‰¤5 empty lines, half otherwise, scaled by weight (default: 10).

Total score is normalized to a percentage based on the sum of weights.

File Processing: Uses pdf.js for PDFs and mammoth.js for DOCX files to extract text client-side.


Visualizations:

A responsive pie chart (Chart.js) shows the score breakdown with dynamic tooltips displaying values and percentages.

A progress bar animates to reflect the total score.

Keyword Analysis: Lists matched (green) and missing (red) keywords to guide resume optimization.

Formatting Tips: Checks for bullet points, headings, and word count, providing actionable suggestions.

Dark Mode: Toggles between light and dark themes, updating text, backgrounds, and chart colors.

Limitations
Keyword Matching: Relies on simple string matching, which may miss synonyms or context-specific terms.

File Processing: Limited to text extraction; complex formatting in PDFs/DOCX may not be fully captured.

Weight Constraints: Users must ensure weights are reasonable to avoid skewed scoring.

No Real-Time Validation: Input validation is basic (e.g., no check for negative weights).
